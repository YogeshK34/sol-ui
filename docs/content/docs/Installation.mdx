# Installation

- **Expo / React Native** (Recommended)
- **Nativewind CSS**

## Automatic Installation

Using the CLI is now the easiest way to start a solUI project. You can initialize your project and add components directly via the CLI:

### Installation 
Execute one of the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
 npm install -g solui
```

<PackageManagers
  commands={{
    npm: "npm install -g solui",
    yarn: "yarn global add solui",
    pnpm: "pnpm add -g solui",
    bun: "bun add -g solui",
  }}
/>


Most components rely on `nativewind` for CSS and `react-native-vector-icons` for a Icons Library. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install nativewind react-native-vector-icons
```

## start server

Install the dependencies to start the local server:
```
npm: "npm run dev",
```


### Adding the Components
Once your solUI project is ready to develop, you can add individual components using the CLI. For example, to add a button component:

```bash
solui add button
```



1. Browse the [Components](/docs/components/badge).
2. Click on the component you want to use.
3. Copy the source code or install via solui CLI.
